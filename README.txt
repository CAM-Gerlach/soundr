SoundR Readme

This project aims to test a new method for diagnosing omega, i.e. vertical 
motion, from data generated from the GOES sounder products. At the present, 
due to high frequency data not being available, it will involve simulated 
sounder data from 15-minute HRRR output, to validate the basic approach. 
If successful, it will proceed to more realistic simulation, and hopefully 
final application to operational GOES sounder or ABI data.
